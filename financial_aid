I have worked diligently in order to be considered for this program. With a CGPA of 8.7, I have tried to manage academics with numerous involvement in projects relating to various field robotics, web development and more and have a proven track record in other co-curricular too. I feel that my acceptance would prove that it's possible to succeed with dedication and hard work alone and I am an ardent believer that money will never be criteria to gain knowledge and skills that would make me more and more confident in the technical field.

I would hate to have this incredible opportunity go to waste based on financial difficulties and I urge you to kindly consider my plea and grant me the financial aid so that this dream course would not slip past from my hands. I would be highly overwhelmed to be a part of this programme.

As an Electrical Engineering undergrad, it becomes quite essential for me to make myself prepared to be a part of the brilliant community of roboticists and scientists who with their everyday contribution make this world an easier place to live in. After putting my hands on several fields like web development and robotic projects I would like to learn in-depth analysis of machine learning. They would not only make myself a more efficient programmer but also would help myself to broaden my knowledge on this vast subject that is always a field to be researched on more and more. I already have a keen interest in mathematics and this, in fact, would be an extension to my problem-solving abilities, if am able to pursue this very course and would surely give my best to complete it. On getting an opportunity to be a part of this course, I would be highly elated to work really hard and would surely try to prove myself.

My financial condition is very bad and I am affording my academic fee with the education loans that I took from the bank so taking a loan again for course is not affordable from my side.
